#Utils

I've released and published this package on npm primarily for my own use,
I often find I need utility functions that otherwise truly awesome libraries
such as underscore lack.  Overtime, I've collected the things I've written
into this modular pattern.  It's not as efficient as I'd like, nor as complete
as I'd hope, but there's a lot of useful stuff here that I regularly use.

Publishing this package is the first step towards an eventual rewrite to 
fully test the package as well as to turn it into ES6 modules for ease of
consumption.

#installation
